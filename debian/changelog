  * Thanks to dh, debconf works again (it didn't for a long time).
  * debian/postrm: Do not worry about debconf, debhelper already does.

  * Do not define or use COMPILE_BY, COMPILE_HOST, COMPILE_DATE
    or COMPILE_TIME. This should make the build reproducible.

seyon (2.20c-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch by Christian Perrier <bubulle@debian.org> :
    - rename debian/config to debian/config.include (avoid confusion
      with the config file needed by debconf)
    - Now uses debconf :
        - Depends on debconf (>= 1.2.9 for gettext)
        - new config script (should properly handle admin-modified settings
          -->debconf is not a registry)
        - rewrote postint
        - new templates file (gettext-based)
      This should make the installation uninteractive. Closes: #147269
      This should also remember the serial port on upgrade; Closes: #92414
    - Any value may be entered for the modem device. Closes: #87564
  * Make sure that the new Seyon-modem config file has the same
    permissions as the old one.
