This is a Debian prepackaged version of seyon.

This package was originally put together by Joey Hess
<joeyh@master.debian.org>, using sources from:

http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/apps/serialcomm/dialout/seyon-2.20c.tar.gz

The following copyright applied to the old package:

======================================================================

  Seyon is Copyright (c) 1992 of Muhammad M. Saggaf. Seyon is not
  public domain. Permission is granted to use and distribute Seyon
  freely for any use and to sell it at any price without reference to
  the copyright owner provided that in all above cases Seyon is intact
  and is not made part of any program either in whole or in part and
  that this copyright notice is included with Seyon. Permission is
  also granted to modify the source as long as the modified source is
  not distributed.

======================================================================

As of May 1999, Muhammad M. Saggaf has given permission for seyon to
be released and maintained under GPL (see
/usr/share/common-licenses/GPL):

Dear Steve:

I received your letter today (yes, I know it took a long time, it took a
trip half-way around the world and then back to my current address in the
U.S.). I share your view about license for Seyon, I think it is too
restrictive, especially that I'm not actively maintaining it. The purpose
behind that restriction was to prevent incompatible versions, really, but I
don't think it was the correct way of doing that. You have my permission to
modify the license (e.g. the GPL is just fine) and distribute the package
with the new license.

My very best wishes,

-- M. Saggaf

For now I am the new upstream maintainer as well as the Debian
maintainer for the seyon package. Upstream sources without the Debian
patches will be made available shortly from sunsite.unc.edu (now
better known as metalab.unc.edu), as above.
